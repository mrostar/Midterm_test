## Introduction
This analysis is meant to help visualize trends in suicide death rates in the United States. It aims to showcase which specific subgroups in the population (broken down by gender, age, and race/ethnic group) have the highest rates. This information can be used to help determine who is at the highest risk and, from there, establish the appropriate preventative measures.Â
